    "2. A short **Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides presentation** (delivered as a PDF export) giving a high-level overview of your methodology and recommendations for **non-technical** stakeholders. Make sure to also add and commit this pdf of your non-technical presentation to your repository with a file name of presentation.pdf.\n",

    "## The Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Please start by reviewing this document. If you have any questions, please ask them in slack ASAP so (a) we can answer the questions and (b) so we can update this repository to make it clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Project Review\n",
    "\n",
    "> **When you start on the project, please also reach out to an instructor immediately to schedule your project review** (if you're not sure who to schedule with, please ask in slack!)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Deliver your PDF presentation to a non-technical stakeholder. \n",
    "In this phase of the review (~10 mins) your instructor will play the part of a non-technical stakeholder that you are presenting your findings to. The presentation should not exceed 5 minutes, giving the \"stakeholder\" 5 minutes to ask questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first half of the presentation (2-3 mins), you should summarize your methodology in a way that will be comprehensible to someone with no background in data science and that will increase their confidence in you and your findings. In the second half (the remaining 2-3 mins) you should summarize your findings and be ready to answer a couple of non-technical questions from the audience. The questions might relate to technical topics (sampling bias, confidence, etc) but will be asked in a non-technical way and need to be answered in a way that does not assume a background in statistics or machine learning. You can assume a smart, business stakeholder, with a non-quantitative college degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Go through the Jupyter Notebook, answering questions about how you made certain decisions. Be ready to explain things like:\n",
    "    * \"how did you pick the question(s) that you did?\"\n",
    "    * \"why are these questions important from a business perspective?\"\n",
    "    * \"how did you decide on the data cleaning options you performed?\"\n",
    "    * \"why did you choose a given method or library?\"\n",
    "    * \"why did you select those visualizations and what did you learn from each of them?\"\n",
    "    * \"why did you pick those features as predictors?\"\n",
    "    * \"how would you interpret the results?\"\n",
    "    * \"how confident are you in the predictive quality of the results?\"\n",
    "    * \"what are some of the things that could cause the results to be wrong?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What won't happen:\n",
    "* You won't be yelled at, belittled, or scolded\n",
    "* You won't be put on the spot without support\n",
    "* There's nothing you can do to instantly fail or blow it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note: We need to receive the URL of your repository at least 24 hours before and please have the project finished at least 3 hours before your review so we can look at your materials in advance.** \n"

    "This section outlines the rubric we'll use to evaluate your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Technical Report Must-Haves\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, your Jupyter Notebook should meet the following specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Organization/Code Cleanliness\n",
    "\n",
    "* The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow,  and code should be commented where appropriate.\n",
    "    * Your notebook should contain 1 - 2 paragraphs briefly explaining your general approach to this project as an intro.\n",
    "    * **Level Up**: The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code.  All functions have docstrings that act as professional-quality documentation\n",
    "    \n",
    "* The notebook is written for technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualizations & EDA\n",
    " \n",
    "* You pose at least 3 meaningful questions and answer them through EDA.  These questions should be well labeled and easy to identify inside the notebook. \n",
    "    * **Level Up**: Each question is clearly answered with a visualization that makes the answer easy to understand. \n",
    "* Your project contains at least 4 meaningful data **visualizations**, with corresponding interpretations. All visualizations are well labeled with axes labels, a title, and a legend (when appropriate) \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Model Quality/Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your notebook shows an **iterative approach** to modeling, and details the parameters and results of the model at each iteration.  \n",
    "    * **Level Up**: Whenever necessary, you briefly explain the changes made from one iteration to the next, and why you made these choices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your **final model**\n",
    "    * You pick at least 3 coefficients from your final model and explain their impact on the price of a house in this dataset.\n",
    "        * Your model should not include any predictors with p-values greater than .05.\n",
    "    * You explain your rationale for selecting your model (not just the learner, also the parameters and variables)\n",
    "        * Minimum 1 paragraph\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Non-Technical Presentation Must-Haves\n",
    "\n",
    "The second deliverable should be a Keynote, PowerPoint or Google Slides presentation delivered as a pdf file in your fork of this repository with the file name of `presentation.pdf` detailing the results of your project.  Your target audience is non-technical people interested in using your findings to maximize their profit when selling their home. \n",

    "Your presentation should:\n",
    "* Content:\n",
    "   * _Based on the results of your models, your presentation should discuss at least two concrete features that highly influence housing prices._\n",
    "* Format:\n",
    "    * Contain between 5 - 10 professional-quality slides.\n",
    "        * **Level Up**: The slides should use visualizations whenever possible, and avoid walls of text.\n",
    "        * Avoid technical jargon and explain the results in a clear, actionable way for non-technical audiences.   \n",
    "    * Take no more than 5 minutes to present.   \n",

    "\n",
    "The end of module projects and project reviews are a critical part of the programme. They give you a chance to both bring together all the skills you've learned into realistic projects and to practice key \"business judgement\" and communication skills that you otherwise might not get as much practice with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The projects are serious and important. They are not graded, but they can be passed and they can be failed. Take the project seriously, put the time in, ask for help from your peers or instructors early and often if you need it, and treat the review as a job interview and you'll do great. We're rooting for you to succeed and we're only going to ask you to take a review again if we believe that you need to. We'll also provide open and honest feedback so you can improve as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this is your first project. We don't expect you to remember all of the terms or to get all of the answers right. If in doubt, be honest. If you don't know something, say so. If you can't remember it, just say so. It's very unusual for someone to complete a project review without being asked a question they're unsure of, we know you might be nervous which may affect your performance. Just be as honest, precise and focused as you can be, and you'll do great!\n"
